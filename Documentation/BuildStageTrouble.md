# Build Stage Documentation

## Troubleshooting
- I had no idea how to verify that my syntax was correct, but this was solved once I downloaded the github actions extension for vscode.
- I had to mess around a lot with what things needed to have hyphens in front of them, but it seems like anything under steps has a hyphen.
- I also had to ess around a lot with indentation, and the various examples I found online were all slightly different.
- YAML is case sensitive. My first word was On, instead of on so I was getting an error.
