# Flutter Application

This is a flutter application I am making from scratch. I will be improving upon and updating it occasionally for the purpose of the project. I will keep updates on what major changes happen and when in this README.

## End Goal
I want to have a calculator that can function in two separate modes. One being a very simple 4 function calculator, and the other having more complex operations and parenthesis for order of operations. I want to add cvery visually pleasing ui and app responses to buttons pressed. I would also like to make sure that it is pleasant to look at no matter where you are running it.

## Progress

I initially made it as the default application from starting a new flutter project on VSCode, which was a counter.
As of 2/17 it is now a functioning basic calculator, with poor UI.
